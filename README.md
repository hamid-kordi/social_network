# Social Network with Django

A small Django project to build a very simple and practical social networking app, with the Django framework.


In this project, we are facing a mini-app. Mini means that you can log in and log out like other networks and publish posts and comments, and on the other hand, leave comments and likes for other people's posts, but you probably cannot upload photos and videos.

## ðŸ›  Skills
python, oop, django, docker.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hamid-kordi/social_network.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd social_network
```

Install docker on your os and run 

```bash
  docker-compose up --build
```

The server has started to work
